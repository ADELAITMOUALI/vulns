Architecting a Professional Red Team Vulnerability Search Engine
Unified CVE Intelligence, Exploit Mapping, and Experimental Operator-Centric UI

In modern offensive security operations, speed, clarity, and contextual awareness are decisive. This project is not a traditional CVE lookup website — it is an operational intelligence console designed for red teamers, exploit developers, and vulnerability researchers.

The platform must aggregate heterogeneous vulnerability data sources into a single, normalized intelligence layer and present them through a UI that feels experimental, tactile, and unlike any existing security tool.

────────────────────────────────────────
1. Red Team Functional Requirements
────────────────────────────────────────

The platform must operate as an active intelligence asset, not a passive database.

Core capabilities:

• Unified Multi-Pivot Search  
  - Query by CVE ID, software name, version strings (CPE-like), year ranges, vulnerability class (RCE, LFI, SSRF, SQLi, auth bypass), or free-text technical keywords.
  - Support partial, fuzzy, and semantic queries.

• Actionable Exploit Mapping  
  - Correlate CVEs with public exploit references:
    - Exploit-DB PoCs
    - Metasploit modules
    - GitHub proof-of-concept repositories
  - Clearly distinguish between:
    - Theoretical vulnerability
    - Public PoC
    - Weaponized exploit

• Evidence-Based Prioritization  
  - Integrate EPSS probability scoring
  - Integrate CISA KEV status
  - Display real-world exploitation likelihood instead of raw CVSS alone

────────────────────────────────────────
2. UI / UX VISION — “OPERATOR MODE”
────────────────────────────────────────

The UI must deliberately avoid conventional dashboard aesthetics.

Design philosophy:
• Inspired by modern Wayland compositors (Hyprland-style motion)
• Cyberpunk minimalism
• Windows 11–grade micro-interactions
• Terminal-native feeling without being a terminal clone

Key UI Concepts:

• Animated Spatial UI  
  - Cards and panels behave like windows in a compositor:
    - Smooth spring-based animations
    - Subtle blur, glow, and depth
    - Context-aware transitions instead of page reloads

• Interactive Exploit Cards  
  - CVEs open like folders (Windows 11 interaction metaphor)
  - Expandable panels reveal:
    - Affected platforms
    - Versions
    - Exploit links
    - Risk indicators
  - No static tables-only UI

• Motion-Driven Feedback  
  - Hover = intelligence preview
  - Click = operational expansion
  - Severity and exploit availability expressed through motion, glow intensity, and color temperature

• Command-Driven UX  
  - Global command palette (Cmd / Ctrl + K)
  - Natural-language style commands:
    - “show RCE exploits for apache 2024”
    - “only exploited in the wild”
    - “filter kernel vulnerabilities”

• Dark-Only Theme (No Light Mode)  
  - Monospace + modern UI font hybrid
  - High contrast without eye fatigue
  - Color reserved for meaning, not decoration

────────────────────────────────────────
3. Frontend Architecture
────────────────────────────────────────

• Next.js App Router (Server Components)
  - Server-side data fetching for low latency
  - Route Handlers used as secure API proxies

• High-performance data visualization
  - Virtualized lists
  - Progressive rendering
  - Zero UI freezing under large result sets

• Component System
  - Headless + highly customized components
  - Emphasis on animation, state transitions, and keyboard navigation

────────────────────────────────────────
4. Data Aggregation & Normalization
────────────────────────────────────────

The platform must ingest and normalize data from multiple heterogeneous sources:

• NVD — official CVE metadata, CVSS, CPE mappings
• Exploit-DB — public exploit PoCs
• Metasploit — exploit modules and target metadata
• GitHub Security Advisories — open-source ecosystem flaws
• Trickest CVE repository
  - Parse CVE directories
  - Read README files
  - Extract exploit references and tooling links

All sources must be:
• Automatically updated
• Deduplicated
• Cross-referenced

Normalization Strategy:
• Normalize all incoming data to OCSF
• Use Detection Finding–style schemas to unify severity, affected assets, and exploit status

────────────────────────────────────────
5. Search Backend
────────────────────────────────────────

• Meilisearch (or equivalent low-latency engine)
  - Sub-50ms responses
  - Typo tolerance for version strings
  - Hybrid keyword + semantic search

• Support:
  - Real-time filtering
  - Incremental refinement
  - Natural-language queries

────────────────────────────────────────
6. Red Team Triage Matrix
────────────────────────────────────────

Each vulnerability must be scored and visualized using a combined triage model:

• EPSS probability
• CISA KEV presence
• Exploit availability
• Platform exposure

The goal is not “highest CVSS”
The goal is “most likely to be exploited successfully”

────────────────────────────────────────
7. Security & Operational Hardening
────────────────────────────────────────

• Strict authentication and authorization
• Rate-limiting to protect upstream APIs
• Hardened middleware paths
• Defensive posture against known framework bypasses

────────────────────────────────────────
8. Final Deliverable
────────────────────────────────────────

A production-ready red team intelligence platform that:

• Feels experimental and advanced
• Prioritizes operator cognition
• Makes exploitability obvious at a glance
• Does NOT resemble existing CVE websites

This is not a dashboard.
This is an offensive security workstation.
